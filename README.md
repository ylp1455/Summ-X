This code will generate a summary of the text document text. The summary will be a concise and informative overview of the original text, highlighting the key points and conclusions. The max_length parameter specifies the maximum length of the summary, in words. The min_length parameter specifies the minimum length of the summary, in words. The do_sample parameter specifies whether to use a sampling method to generate the summary. If do_sample=False, then the summary will be generated using a greedy method.
